        <a href="/en/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Use of Google integrations</h2>
      <p>
        When the User connects their Google account (e.g. Google Contacts or
        Google Calendar), they authorize VivaSpeak to access and operate on
        those services in accordance with the permissions granted via Google
        OAuth. The User is responsible for keeping such permissions active and
        may revoke them at any time from their
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google account</a>
        or from VivaSpeak settings. The use of Google data is additionally
        governed by our
        <a href="/en/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Technical operator / authorized third party</h2>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak acts as a <strong>technical provider</strong> that operates messaging
        integrations (including the WhatsApp Business API) <strong>on behalf of the Client</strong>,
        following the Client's instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak does not decide or control the content of messages, flows, or
        automated responses, which are defined or authorized by the Client.
      </p>

      <h2>9. WhatsApp and third parties</h2>
      <p>
        The Client is solely responsible for complying with the policies of WhatsApp,
        Meta, and external providers. VivaSpeak does not own the channel or the
        number, and does not control suspensions, limits, or blocks imposed by
        third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Client must ensure user consent (opt-in), honor opt-out requests,
        use approved templates when required, and provide clear support paths.
        WhatsApp messaging is also governed by our
        <a href="/en/whatsapp-messaging-policy" target="_blank"
          >WhatsApp Messaging Policy</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak uses external technology providers to deliver the service. The
        Client acknowledges that availability, limits, and operation of those
        services depend on third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>10. AI clause</h2>
      <p>
        Messaging data processed by VivaSpeak <strong>is not used to train general-purpose AI models</strong>,
        and is not shared between clients. The AI operates in a
        <strong>deterministic and/or contextual</strong> manner, limited to providing
        the contracted service for each Client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under no circumstances is data used to train, retrain, or improve general-purpose
        language or artificial intelligence models.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Call recording and transcription</h2>
      <p>
        This clause applies to inbound and outbound calls made to or from

      </p>
      <p>
        Calls made to numbers managed by VivaSpeak may be <strong>recorded and transcribed using artificial intelligence systems</strong>,
        <strong>when permitted by applicable law</strong>,
        for the purpose of providing the contracted service, handling requests,
        improving service quality, and ensuring the proper functioning of the
        voice agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        These recordings and transcripts may include personal data and will be
        processed in accordance with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>
        and applicable data protection regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        By initiating a call, the user <strong>expressly accepts</strong> this
        processing. If the user does not agree, they must refrain from making
        the call or request an alternative contact channel.
      </p>

        <strong>three months of payments</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Right of Withdrawal (EU Consumers)</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>18. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any 
        time. If changes are significant, we will notify users by email or 
        through a notice on our website. Continued use of the Services 
        constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>20. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Before initiating legal action, both parties agree to attempt resolution 
        through mediation. If mediation fails, disputes will be resolved through
