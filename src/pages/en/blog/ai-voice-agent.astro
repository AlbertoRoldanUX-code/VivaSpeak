    <h1>What an AI Voice Agent Is and How It Works (Practical Explanation)</h1>

    <p>
      An <strong>AI voice agent</strong> is a system that answers calls like a human,
      understands natural conversation, accesses your real data (calendar, CRM, business
      hours) and performs actions such as booking appointments, sending emails,
      opening tickets, or transferring the call to a human.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike a voicemail or an IVR (“press 1, press 2”), an AI voice agent responds naturally,
      remembers context, and can handle complex dialogues.
    </p>

    <h2>What it can do exactly</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Answer calls in under one second.</li>
      <li>Speak multiple languages with natural, human-like voice.</li>
      <li>Check availability in your real calendar: Google Calendar or Nubimed.</li>
      <li>Create, move, or cancel appointments.</li>
      <li>Send automatic summaries via email or WhatsApp.</li>
      <li>Detect when it should transfer to a human.</li>
      <li>Record and transcribe every call.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At VivaSpeak we use them in clinics, real estate agencies, online stores and any
      business that receives many calls or messages outside business hours.
    </p>

    <h2>How an AI voice agent works step by step</h2>

    <h3>1. The customer calls your number (landline or mobile)</h3>
    <p>
      The call is automatically routed to the <strong>agent’s number</strong> without changing
      your existing business number.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The agent listens and understands in real time</h3>
    <p>
      It interprets the intent: booking, cancelling, asking for prices, schedules,
      availability, or information about a property.
    </p>

    <h3>3. It checks your real data</h3>
    <p>Depending on your business:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clinics:</strong> Nubimed (schedules, services, durations).</li>
      <li><strong>General businesses:</strong> Google Calendar.</li>
      <li><strong>Real estate:</strong> CRM or available listings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. It responds with a natural voice</h3>
    <p>
      The voices are almost indistinguishable from a real human. They adjust tone,
      pauses, rhythm and empathy.
    </p>

    <h3>5. It performs actions</h3>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“I can offer you an appointment on Tuesday at 4:00 pm. Does that work for you?”</li>
      <li>“Let me transfer you to a colleague now.”</li>
      <li>“I'll send you the property brochure on WhatsApp.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. It sends a summary to your team</h3>
    <p>
      When the call ends, the agent automatically sends an email or WhatsApp message with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the full transcription,</li>
      <li>the detected intent,</li>
      <li>the outcome,</li>
      <li>the selected option,</li>
      <li>the recording,</li>
      <li>next steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why businesses are adopting them</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>24/7 answering without hiring more staff.</li>
      <li>No fatigue, no errors, no missed opportunities.</li>
      <li>Higher conversion from calls to customers.</li>
      <li>Cleans your schedule by avoiding double bookings or wrong data.</li>
      <li>Scales without increasing costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At VivaSpeak our agents are specialized by sector:
      <strong>Clara</strong> (clinics), <strong>Laura</strong> (real estate),
      <strong>Santiago</strong> (HR), and fully customized agents.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      An AI voice agent is not a rigid robot or an old IVR. It is a conversational
      assistant capable of handling real calls like a person: scheduling, confirming,
      answering, and transferring when needed.
