    <h1>AI Voice Agent for Real Estate: How It Works and Why It Increases Leads and Property Visits</h1>

    <p>
      Most real estate agencies lose opportunities every day: missed calls, buyers who never
      leave their details, property owners who call once and don’t insist, or leads that get
      forgotten after the first attempt. An <strong>AI voice agent</strong> solves all of this
      without hiring more staff.
    </p>

    <p>
      It works like a commercial assistant that answers calls 24/7, provides information about
      each property and captures qualified leads so the sales team only speaks with people who
      are genuinely interested.
    </p>

    <h2>What an AI Voice Assistant Can Do for a Real Estate Agency</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Answer buyer calls in less than one second.</li>
      <li>Provide information about developments, areas, prices and unit types.</li>
      <li>Detect real interest and request name and phone number.</li>
      <li>Book property visits or office appointments.</li>
      <li>Automatically send property listings via WhatsApp or email.</li>
      <li>Handle missed calls with automatic callback.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a human agent when the lead is ready.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works in Practice</h2>

    <h3>1. The client calls the real estate agency's number</h3>
    <p>
      You don’t need to change your number. The call is simply routed to the AI voice agent.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The AI understands the caller’s intention</h3>
    <p>
      Are they looking for general information? A specific development? Prices?  
      Or are they trying to sell their property?
    </p>

    <h3>3. The AI responds using real and up-to-date information</h3>
    <p>
      The agent speaks based on your <strong>knowledge base</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>development descriptions,</li>
      <li>unit types and prices,</li>
      <li>area details,</li>
      <li>surface, features, and FAQs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. It captures the lead when there is real interest</h3>
    <p>The agent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>asks for <strong>name and phone number</strong>,</li>
      <li>validates budget, preferred area and number of bedrooms,</li>
      <li>and records everything.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. It books a visit or a sales call</h3>
    <p>The agent can directly propose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An office appointment,</li>
      <li>a property visit,</li>
      <li>or a sales call.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. It automatically notifies the sales team</h3>
    <p>You receive an email or WhatsApp with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead details,</li>
      <li>full call transcription,</li>
      <li>preferences,</li>
      <li>call recording.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real Use Cases in Real Estate</h2>

    <h3>1. Incoming calls from buyers</h3>
    <p>
      Ideal for active developments, new builds or second-hand listings.  
      The AI answers every time, filters out low-quality leads and sends only real buyers to the team.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Missed calls</h3>
    <p>
      If someone calls outside office hours or during peak moments, the AI automatically calls back
      and collects the needed information.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Visit scheduling</h3>
    <p>
      The agent proposes visit times on the spot and only passes on leads who already said “I want to see it”.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Detailed information about developments</h3>
    <p>
      The AI can talk about the neighborhood, prices, terraces, orientation or floor plans based on your data.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Property owner prospecting (Outbound)</h3>
    <p>
      In outbound mode, the AI can make the first contact, verify availability, check interest in a meeting,
      and record everything so the sales advisor can then close the deal.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits for Real Estate Agencies</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>No more lost opportunities.</li>
      <li>More visits booked = more real sales opportunities.</li>
      <li>Your agents only deal with qualified leads.</li>
      <li>The AI speaks multiple languages if needed.</li>
      <li>Works 365 days a year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      An AI voice agent does not replace your sales team — it strengthens it.  
      It filters, informs, captures leads and books visits so your agents can focus on closing sales.
