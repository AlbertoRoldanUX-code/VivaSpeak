    <h1>How to Create the Perfect Knowledge Base for Your AI Voice Agent</h1>

    <p>
      An AI voice agent is only as good as the information you give it.
      A well-designed <strong>knowledge base</strong> makes the agent sound natural,
      reliable and aligned with your business. A poorly structured one
      causes confusion, incorrect answers or unnecessary transfers to a human.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this guide you’ll learn the recommended structure, examples by industry
      and the most common mistakes to avoid.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Knowledge Base Matters</h2>

    <p>
      The knowledge base is where your AI learns:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>how your business works,</li>
      <li>what you offer,</li>
      <li>your prices, schedules and policies,</li>
      <li>frequently asked questions,</li>
      <li>and how to respond in your tone of voice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A good structure improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Structure</h2>

    <p>Use this exact structure to keep the agent focused and consistent:</p>

    <h3>1. Business Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What the business does.</li>
      <li>Who it's for.</li>
      <li>Core services/product categories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Hours and Location</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening hours.</li>
      <li>Address and how to get there.</li>
      <li>Parking or access details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Services and Prices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each service with a clear, short description.</li>
      <li>Price or price range.</li>
      <li>Duration (for clinics, salons, fitness studios, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <p>Typical questions the agent must answer correctly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“What does this treatment include?”</li>
      <li>“How long does it take?”</li>
      <li>“Do I need preparation?”</li>
      <li>“Is it painful?”</li>
      <li>“What payment methods do you accept?”</li>
      <li>“Are you open on weekends?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Policies & Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancellation policy.</li>
      <li>Rescheduling rules.</li>
      <li>Preparation instructions.</li>
      <li>Arrival guidelines for first-time clients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. How the Agent Should Communicate</h3>
    <p>
      Define the tone and style:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Friendly and empathetic.</li>
      <li>Short and direct answers.</li>
      <li>Never guess — only respond using this knowledge base.</li>
      <li>Offer to transfer when unsure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples by Industry</h2>

    <h3>🏥 Clinics (Nubimed or Google Calendar)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>List of treatments with duration.</li>
      <li>Which doctor performs which service.</li>
      <li>Preparation guidelines.</li>
      <li>How to book, move or cancel appointments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🏡 Real Estate Agencies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Active listings and key details (typologies, prices, location).</li>

      <li>Service descriptions.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

      <li>Writing long paragraphs (keep answers short).</li>
      <li>Mixing different topics into one block.</li>
      <li>Forgetting prices or durations.</li>
      <li>Using vague descriptions.</li>
      <li>Letting the agent improvise (never do this).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      A well-structured knowledge base makes your AI voice agent faster,
      more accurate and more natural in conversation.  
      It’s the easiest way to reduce errors, improve customer experience
      and automate your business effectively.
