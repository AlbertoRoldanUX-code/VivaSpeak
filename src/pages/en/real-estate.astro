              “The main problem we had was managing the high volume of calls, especially for rentals —in the Balearics there can be 200+ applications for a single property. We wanted a more personal service than a simple answering machine. <strong>Now we cover 24h, 7 days a week, we don't lose contacts, and we pre-qualify in a fraction of the time</strong>, even during demand peaks. It works very well, it's very polished.”
