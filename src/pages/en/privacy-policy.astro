        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Use of Google data</h2>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak voice agents always act as technical intermediaries of the user and execute actions only within the limits defined by the user themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a user authenticates with <strong>Google OAuth</strong> or connects
        their Google account to VivaSpeak via <strong>Google APIs</strong>, we
        may access the following Google user data, depending on the permissions
        granted:
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Google People API / Contacts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>User name</li>
        <li>Google account identifier</li>
        <li>User contacts (name, phone, email, and company)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contacts are accessed in <strong>read-only</strong> mode
        (<strong>contacts.readonly</strong>). VivaSpeak does not modify,
        delete, or sync contact data in the user's Google account.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Google Calendar API</h3>
      <p>
        To that end, VivaSpeak uses the following Google Calendar permissions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading the user's available calendars (calendar.calendarlist.readonly)</li>
        <li>Querying availability (calendar.freebusy)</li>
        <li>Creating and managing events explicitly requested by the user (calendar.events)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Event creation is performed only when the user explicitly requests it, either directly from the VivaSpeak platform or through a voice agent configured by the user themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of voice agents, they act as technical representatives of the user and perform the scheduling action only when the end user gives explicit consent during the call.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> We use Google Calendar solely to display
        availability, create events requested by the user, and sync appointments
        within VivaSpeak. This includes querying availability (free/busy) information without accessing event content when not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak does not access the detailed content of events (title, description, attendees) except when strictly necessary to create or modify an appointment explicitly requested by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Read and write:</strong> We read calendar events to display
        availability and we write to the calendar when the user requests
        creating or updating appointments (e.g. appointments booked through the
        voice agent). We do not modify or delete events without the user's
        request. VivaSpeak does not delete existing events or perform automatic
        modifications without explicit user action.
      </p>
      <p>
        VivaSpeak does not create, modify, or delete calendar events automatically or proactively. All actions on events require a direct instruction from the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prohibited use — Google data (Contacts and Calendar):</strong>
        We do not use Google data for advertising, commercial profiling, sale of data, or training of artificial intelligence models.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Revocation:</strong> The user may revoke access to Google
        Calendar (and other Google data) at any time from their
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google account</a>
        or from their account settings in VivaSpeak.
      </p>

      <p>We use Google data (contacts and calendar) solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable access to the platform</li>
        <li>Identify the user within the system</li>
        <li>Import and manage their contact book inside VivaSpeak</li>
        <li>Display availability and create and sync appointments in Google Calendar</li>
        <li>Provide the features requested by the user</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>We process your data based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> When you submit a form, you provide explicit
          consent for data processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> We process your data to respond
          to inquiries and enhance our services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact form submissions: <strong>Up to 12 months</strong></li>
        <li>Calendly booking details: <strong>Up to 24 months</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contacts imported from Google are retained while the user keeps their
        account active or until they request deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Calendar data is retained only while the user keeps the
        integration active and is deleted or no longer processed when the user
        revokes access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You can request data deletion at any time</strong> unless we are
        legally required to retain it.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade personal data. However,
        we may share information with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calendly:</strong> For scheduling demo meetings.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers:</strong> For email communication and
          analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All third parties follow strict
        <strong>data protection measures</strong> .
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell or share Google user data with third parties. It is used
        only to operate the service.
      </p>
      <h3>Security Measures:</h3>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data
        from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google user data is stored securely and protected with encryption and
        access controls.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Call recording and transcription</h2>
      <p>
        This clause applies to inbound and outbound calls made to or from
        numbers managed by VivaSpeak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calls made to numbers managed by VivaSpeak may be <strong>recorded and transcribed using artificial intelligence systems</strong>
        for the purpose of providing the contracted service, handling requests,
        improving service quality, and ensuring the proper functioning of the
        voice agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        These recordings and transcripts may include personal data and will be
        processed in accordance with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>
        and applicable data protection regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        By initiating a call, the user <strong>expressly accepts</strong> this
        processing. If the user does not agree, they must refrain from making
        the call or request an alternative contact channel.
      </p>
      <h2>9. WhatsApp Messaging</h2>
      <p>
        If a user has provided consent to receive WhatsApp messages, we may
        send service-related communications (for example, support, reminders, or

        or contacting us at
