      <h1>WhatsApp Messaging Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This policy applies to messages sent through the WhatsApp Business
        Platform by VivaSpeak, acting as a technical provider for its Clients.
        WhatsApp use is subject to the
        <a
          href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy</a
        >, the
        <a
          href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >WhatsApp Business Terms</a
        >, and applicable Meta policies.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Opt-in (consent)</h2>
      <p>
        We only contact people who have provided their phone number and given
        explicit permission to receive WhatsApp messages. The Client is
        responsible for obtaining, recording, and storing proof of opt-in in
        accordance with applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consent must describe the categories of messages users will receive
        (for example, support, reminders, updates, or offers) and must be clear,
        informed, and verifiable.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Message types and the 24-hour window</h2>
      <p>
        Messages are used for legitimate service purposes such as support,
        confirmations, reminders, request follow-up, or operational
        communications. Outside the 24-hour window since the user's last
        message, we only send messages using WhatsApp-approved templates.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Opt-out (unsubscribe)</h2>
      <p>
        Users may opt out at any time. To stop receiving messages, they can
        reply with <strong>STOP</strong> or an equivalent keyword, or contact us
        by email or phone at
        <a href="mailto:contact@vivaspeak.com">contact@vivaspeak.com</a> / +34 951
        798 932. We honor opt-out requests immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Support and escalation</h2>
      <p>
        During WhatsApp conversations we provide clear escalation paths to a
        human agent, phone, email, or a web form. You can also reach us at
        <a href="/en/#contact">vivaspeak.com/en/#contact</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data protection</h2>
      <p>
        We do not request or allow sensitive data such as full payment card
        numbers, financial credentials, or government IDs. Data handling is
        governed by our
        <a href="/en/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited content</h2>
      <p>
        Illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, discriminatory, or offensive content
        is not allowed, nor is the promotion of prohibited or restricted goods
        or services under WhatsApp policy.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Non-compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Violations of this policy or WhatsApp policies may result in
        restrictions, suspension, or termination of service.
